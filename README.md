Created by Pouyan Shahidi<br>
This interactive map presents two georeferenced plates from Charles E. Goad’s Atlas of the City of Toronto and Suburbs (1910), depicting North Station Street — now known as Rosemount Street (Weston, York) — and its surrounding area.
Each time you click on the historical maps, they will cycle through full visibility (100% opacity), partial transparency (50% opacity), and complete invisibility (0% opacity), in that order.
Use the layer control (top right) to toggle data layers, and explore the distance measurement and address search tools (top left).
